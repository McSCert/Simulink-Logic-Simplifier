# Simulink Logic Simplifier Tool

The Simulink Logic Simplifier tool automatically simplifies Simulink designs to
reduce complexity and save developers time during development and refactor-
ing. The tool specifically focuses on simplifying implementations of combinato-
rial logic in Simulink, such as those making use of logical operators, relational
operators, and many others. After a simplifiation is performed, the tool also
facilitates verification to ensure that the behaviour of the original system is
preserved in the results.
