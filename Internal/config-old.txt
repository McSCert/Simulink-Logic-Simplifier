## THE REMAINING RULES NEED TO BE TESTED AGAIN, MAJOR CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED TO THE TOOL

#DELETE_UNUSED Indicates whether or not to delete blocks which are unused in the
#	final model.
#Default is off.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	on (blocks will be deleted if not a SubSystem and all of its outports are 
#		unused, one way this could occur is if the original system has an Inport
#		which feeds its signal into an if block that doesn't depend on that signal), 
#	off (blocks that would have been deleted are left in the system for the user to
#		decide what to do)
delete_unused: off

#GENERATED_BLOCK_REUSE_RULE
#Default is reuse.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	reuse (involves using branching connections if generated blocks are to be used more than once)
#	single-use (involves generating additional blocks with the same signal as other generated blocks)
generated_block_reuse_rule: reuse
