# SUBSYSTEM_RULE Indicates how to address subsystems in the simplification process.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#	full-simplify     contents of subsystems will be integrated into the
#		              simplification of other blocks
#	part-simplify     contents of subsystems will be simplified, but other blocks
#		              will see them as a black-boxes for the sake of their simplification
#	blackbox          subsystems will not be modified during simplification and their
#		              output will not be assumed
#
# Default is blackbox.
#
subsystem_rule: blackbox

# BLOCKS_TO_SIMPLIFY Indicates which blocks to try to simplify.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#	selected      to simplify selected blocks
#	unselected    to simplify blocks in the system, except those selected
#
# Default is selected.
#
blocks_to_simplify: selected

# GENERATE_MODE Indicates which blocks to generate in the simplification.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#	all               to generate all blocks in the system
#	simplifiedonly    to generate only blocks that are being simplified i.e. the
#		              same set as chosen by BLOCKS_TO_SIMPLIF
#
# Default is all.
#
generate_mode: all

# EXTRA_SUPPORT_FUNCTION Indicates a function to use to generate expressions for
# cases beyond what is supported by the default tool. Certain companies with
# a wide variety of custom blocks may desire this functionality.
#
# Acceptable parameter values:
#	The value can be left blank or be a valid function on the MATLAB
#	search path. When left blank, defaultExtraSupport.m is used. This
#	corresponds with no added support from the main tool.
#
# Default is nothing (leave the space blank)
#
extra_support_function: 

# HANDLE_UNUSED Indicates how to handle blocks that do not impact output
# (identified as blocks with only unconnected outports).
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#   do-nothing           unconnected ports are left as-is in the generated model
#   delete               to delete blocks in the top-level system that don't contribute to output
#   ground-and-terminate to connect unconnected ports to a Ground/Terminators
#                        (applies to all levels of the generated system)
#
# Default is do-nothing.
#
handle_unused: do-nothing
