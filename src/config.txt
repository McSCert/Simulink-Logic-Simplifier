#DELETE_UNUSED Indicates whether or not to delete blocks which are unused in the
#	final model.
#Default is off.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	on (blocks will be deleted if not a SubSystem and all of its outports are 
#		unused, one way this could occur is if the original system has an Inport
#		which feeds its signal into an if block that doesn't depend on that signal), 
#	off (blocks that would have been deleted are left in the system for the user to
#		decide what to do)
delete_unused: on

#SUBSYSTEM_RULE Indicates how to address subsystems in the simplification process.
#Default is blackbox.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	full-simplify (contents of subsystems will be integrated into the simplification
#		of other blocks),
#	part-simplify (contents of subsystems will be simplified, but other blocks will
#		see them as a black box for the sake of their simplification), 
#	blackbox (subsystems will not be modified during simplification and there 
#		output will not be assumed)
