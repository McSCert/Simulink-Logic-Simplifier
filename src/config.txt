#SUBSYSTEM_RULE Indicates how to address subsystems in the simplification 
#   process.
#Default is blackbox.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	full-simplify (contents of subsystems will be integrated into the 
#		simplification of other blocks),
#	part-simplify (contents of subsystems will be simplified, but other blocks 
#		will see them as a black-boxes for the sake of their simplification), 
#	blackbox (subsystems will not be modified during simplification and their 
#		output will not be assumed).
subsystem_rule: blackbox

#BLOCKS_TO_SIMPLIFY Indicates which blocks to try to simplify.
#Default is selected.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	selected (simplifies selected blocks),
#	unselected (simplifies blocks in the system except the ones that are 
#		selected).
blocks_to_simplify: selected

#GENERATE_MODE Indicates which blocks to generate in the simplification.
#Default is all.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	all (generates all blocks in the system),
#	simplifiedonly (generates only blocks that are being simplified i.e. the 
#		same set as chosen by BLOCKS_TO_SIMPLIFY).
generate_mode: all

#EXTRA_SUPPORT_FUNCTION Indicates a function to use to generate expressions for
#	cases beyond what is supported by the default tool. Certain companies with 
#	a wide variety of custom blocks may desire this functionality.
#Default is nothing (leave the space blank)
#
#Acceptable parameter values:
#	The value should either be left blank or be a valid function on the MATLAB 
#	search path. When left blank defaultExtraSupport.m will be used and this
#	corresponds with no added support from the main tool.
extra_support_function: fcaSupport

#HANDLE_UNUSED Indicates how to handle blocks that do not impact output 
#   (identified as blocks with only unconnected outports).
#Default is do-nothing
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#   do-nothing (unconnected ports are left as-is in the generated model),
#   delete (delete blocks in the top-level system that don't contribute to 
#       output),
#   ground-and-terminate (connects unconnected ports to a Ground or 
#       Terminator block - this applies to all levels of the generated system).
handle_unused: do-nothing
